The warrior who is beholden to a lord or a church, the priest dedicated to healing the wretched - anyone who cannot stand by while others suffer. They will chase evil to the end of the world.",

		{
			name = "Lawful Neutral",
			desc = "The hater of chaos, a lawful neutral character will stick to the letter of the law, whether it is their personal code of rules, their king's, or their religion's. This character finds chaos as abhorrent as evil and will not bend their personal guidelines even to help another if it will contribute to chaos.",

			examples = { "The Kirin Tor", "Malfurion Stormrage", "Maiev Shadowsong", },
		},
		{
			name = "Lawful Evil",
			desc = "A being who gains power through methodically destroying others is lawful evil. Power comes through order, but one can be orderly about slaughtering innocents. Tradition is important, but goodness is not.",

			name = "True Neutral",
			desc = "A middle-of-the-road character, a neutral character finds it difficult to fit into any other distinction. They do what seems to be a good idea, whether it flows with law or chaos, good or evil. Often a follower and at times superb leaders, they'll rarely go against the group.", 
			descriptors = "",

		{
			name = "Neutral Evil",
